- Send a text message when a product is found
- Allow searching for multiple products
	- Found output needs to indicate product
- Rather than waiting an arbitrary duration and having a second timer to update display, refactor timer code to set a date+time to next check, and periodically (second?) see if that time has come, if so check. 
- Slightly randomize the time between searches
- turn on gzip/deflate decoding in request/response.
